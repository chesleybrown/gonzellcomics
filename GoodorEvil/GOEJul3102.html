Dear Gonzell and da Whipped Steve,<br>
<br>
Well first I would like to thank Gonzell on his help with the question. And<br>
next I would like to say this so Steve, man you are just jealous that my mom's<br>
hotter then your's. Man that's all ya can do I mean everyone's mom ain't pretty<br> 
and all (no offence to the rest of the mom's out there). Well anyways to the<br>
question.... If there was a girl that you kinda liked, but she already had a<br>
close friend that we consider a boyfriend,and they are kinda close and you<br>
wanted to be in that spot instead of the other guy. How would Gonzell go about<br>
this because to be honset I dont care how Steve would handle it because he is<br>
Whipped.<br>

Dear Ryan The Nerd Monkey,<br>
<br>
First, no problem, I guess helping people and being perfect is just what I'm<br>
all about. I don't like what your saying about your "momma" because any child<br>
that thinks his "momma" is hot...well....thats just discusting! Anyway, to<br>
the answer to your question, well I would have to say, NO hitting on the girl.<br>
See, in "Man" terms, she is "TAKEN." Meaning, she can only be released by the<br>
Man. So it is a golden rule, you can't TAKE another Man's girl, unless you<br>
think that guy is treating the girl unfairly. Here is my advise to try and get<br>
her, without breaking the golden rule. First, look for signs of them ever<br>
wanting to break up, ex: If they seem to drift farther apart, but there are<br>
lots of signs and I'm not listing them all. Anyway, if you think she is being<br>
VERY miss treated, you should tell someone right away. Whatever you do,<br>
DON'T break the "Golden Rule!"<br>
<br>
Also, if a may say so, I wouldn't even try something like this. Much to rich<br>
for my blood, if you know what I mean....cause I don't know. You should just<br>
shoot for a sexy, young and SINGLE girl, I can almost promise you that you'll<br>
get better results then trying to get a "TAKEN" girl.<br>
<br>
THE GOLDEN RULE!<br>

Dear Ryan The Nerd Monkey Shit Eater,<br>
<br>
I've spent many long weeks considering your question and obsurd remarks...*hahah*<br>
as if. ANYWHO, if your momma's so hot sicko why don't you just bone her. Wait a sec<br>
That's probably what you were talking about...she's taken.....man, you're sick!<br>
Sicker than me! Hell man if you want her that bad just push your dad over the stairs<br>
and you're in right? But that's way out of my league and now that we know the real<br>
you, Gonzell and I are going to have to ask you kindly to stop posting or viewing our<br>
website for the sake of all the non-disturbed fans we have. Hope you have a lovely son<br>
or daughter and that you're a good brother to him or her. Ugh, man I'm going on break for<br>
a few days. These questions are getting too outrageous.<br>
<br>
Dude, you need REAL help...<br>
Steve
