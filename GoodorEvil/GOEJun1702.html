Dear Gonzell and Steve,<br>
<br>
Hello. I have a big problem guys, and I'm really hopping<br>
that you guys will be able to help me out. Well, here I go!<br>
<br>
See, my friends use to always come over to my house and we<br>
all play video games, such as Starcraft and Perfect Dark. We<br>
even talked about games, infact, we talked about games everywhere!<br>
Now here comes the real problem which I just don't know what to<br>
do about it. My friends don't really like video games anymore.<br>
They go out to parties, and I like never see them anymore. They<br>
NEVER talk about video games anymore, just hot women and I'm scared<br>
I want my old friends back, the ones who LOVED video games! PLEASE!!!<br>
HELP ME!!!<br>
<br>

Well, I know just what you should do! Don't hang out with them<br>
anymore. I mean, they are most likely doing drugs and all that crap<br>
Maybe even having SEX, maybe UNPROTECTED sex!!! They could be drinking!<br>
Getting drunk and getting all the sluts and ho's they ever wanted, for<br>
free! Now, I'm sure you don't want this. I think you should stay home, get<br>
the internet, if you don't already have it, and go play some multipayer<br>
online where you can find REAL friends.<br>
<br>
Your TRUE best friend,<br>
Gonzell

You see, this is how it be's. Like the famous words of some pot head rapper,<br> 
"Smoke weed everyday". Oh and the drinking and sex is all good too. Just make sure<br>
to keep the sexing uprotected, I mean what's the point if there's no suspense<br> 
in the fact that you might have gotten the chick pregnant? So in conclusion, burn<br> 
the video games and go get laid before you become Gonzell making pathetic comics<br> 
about some fantasy hero game that makes half sense on occasion.<br> 
<br>
Did somebody say weed?<br>
