Dear Gonzell and Steve,<br>
<br>
Ok. There is a group of 3 lovers (6 people total)<br>
All the guys enjoy the show 'Robot Wars' but the gals hate it.<br> 
What should the guys do? If we are all together and it comes on.<br>
<br>

Dear Will,<br>
<br>
I know just what you should do Will. When the show comes on and the gals<br>
are there to, just tape the show. Then you can watch it latter when they<br>
go home. If you don't have a VCR or a blank video tape, I suggest you<br>
try "not" to have them over when "Robot Wars" is on tv, but whatever you<br>
do, DON'T make it obvious that you don't want them over because your favorite<br>
show is on, then they would think you like the show more then them, which<br>
would be VERY bad! Also, don't think about breaking up with them, just because<br>
they don't like the same shows as you. If we all like the same things in<br>
relationships, then it would be boring as hell.<br>
<br>
The one that knows it all, Gonzell

Dear Will,
<br><br>
Okay what's with all this relationship/lover crap? Don't you people have lives?<br>
Screw those hoes and if they lay off with the screwing because of "feelings" and<br>
"issues" you're just going to have to be more "aggressive" with them. If all else<br>
fails dispose of them as you would a deceased pet and go wonder the alleys for<br> 
some new, if used, merchandise. Oh and Robot Wars is for queers. I don't know how<br> 
you could say it seriously and with a straight face that you watch that show. So<br> 
I'm just assuming you're good actors trying to trip us on the questioning. Damn it,<br> 
that was the day TV broadcasting got fed to the rats...or was that the day wrestling<br>
began competing in the phony soap end of television. Ugh, whatever happen to real<br> 
violence?
<br><br>
Longing for the good ol' days,<br>
Steve
