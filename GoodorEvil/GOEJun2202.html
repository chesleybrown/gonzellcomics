Dear Gonzell and Steve,<br>
<br>
So Gonzell i never really looked at your page yet. But it seems cool<br>
so I hope you can answer my question.......<br> 
<br>
My pal who actually does the "Evil" part of this thing, has a girlfriend....<br>
and I consider him "Wipped" cause he does EVEYTHING that she tells him to do.<br>
HE denys this totally. I was wonderin what the hell i can do to get it through<br>
his thick head. I hope you are able to answer my Question.<br>

Dear Ryan The Nerd Monkey,<br>
<br>
Well, being good and all, I can't suggest any "violent" ideas. What you<br>
should ask yourself is, "Am I sure Steve's girlfriend has complete control<br>
over him?" If you still think so, there is nothing you can do about it. Since<br>
your talking about "Steve's girlfriend," Steve will never admit that his<br>
girlfriend has him..."whipped." Well, I am sorry I can't really help with your<br>
question. I suggest that since you know he is "whipped,' you should keep it at<br>
that, cause like I said, he will not admit to it.<br>
<br>
Not all problems can be solved,<br>
Gonzell

Dear Ryan The Nerd Monkey,<br>
<br>
Girlfriend?¿ Ohhhh, you mean that cute bitch who's always on my penis?<br>
Ya she's good with a whip but I think I'm a have little more skill in that<br> 
department, espically when it comes to whipping your mama everynight. That's<br> 
right need a whip to keep that wild animal in line!! Yeeeehawwww!!<br>
