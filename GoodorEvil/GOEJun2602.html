Dear Gonzell and Steve,<br>
<br>
I figure I must be pretty desperate to be asking two almost perfect strangers<br>
about my personal life;but I guess it's worth a try. So Well here goes...I am<br>
positively sure I am in love with this guy named Chris, and he used to love me<br> 
too, but now he likes this other girl and I just found out it's only because<br>
her boobs are a lil' bigger than mine! I really  love him though and no matter<br> 
how I try I can't seem to let go I try and try but every time I get this<br> 
feeling about him like I dunno I just know that I love him and I really want<br> 
him back. Problem is Jacki is popular and I'm not so popular;but also Jacki is<br> 
also a real fat bitch literally fat and I ain't I'm cuter than her alot. He<br> 
still flirts w/me and I flirt w/him but he refuses to go w/me. He says that I<br> 
get too jealous when he flirts w/other girls but really honestly I'm just<br> 
showing the other girls he's mine;but now I can't seem to get him back.<br>

Dear Sarah Elizabeth,<br>
<br>
This is indeed a difficult question. The thing is, you really shouldn't be so<br>
"jealous." Well, I'll get to that later, the problem I have to solve now is<br>
how you can get back with this guy. I would have to say you should go up to<br>
him and say "Chris, I like you very much, and I have great feelings for you.<br>
I know I'm not the hottest thing in town, and I know I'm not that popular,<br>
but Chris, please give me another chance, I promise I won't be so jealous,<br>
(I'll get to the "why you shouldn't be so jealous part" later). And if you<br>
not willing to give me another chance, thats fine with me!" Of course, I<br>
know you going to say "Like the hell I'm going to do that!" But don't worry,<br>
I have a plan "B" if your not that confident of yourself, and here it is.<br>
<br>
Another way to get him back is, phone him, and explain how you feel, and how<br>
you can improve on being a girlfriend, hopefully he will understand you, if<br>
not, and he doesn't want to be your boyfriend, then its most likely that he<br>
has no feelings for you, and he doesn't want any feelings for you. In this<br>
case, HIS A JERK! Don't bother with him anymore. Go find some other guy, who<br>
you know will have feelings for you, and care for you. (I suggest someone<br>
good looking ;)<br>
<br>
Well, now here is the thing, if Chris isn't a jerk. Here is why you should<br>
try not to be so jealous. Guys don't want to feel like they have no other<br>
choices, but to be with you. Not being allowed to look at another girl, and<br>
not even allowed to speak with other girls will make him feel like you have<br>
him under your finger, as if you're the boss. No guy wants this. Both should<br>
have equal power over each other. Something like abuse, I guess, well, I<br>
think I'm just losing myself here. And this is about the longest thing I<br>
typed. After all, I am new at this. I hope you get SOMETHING out of my<br>
advise. <FONT Color="#f00000">Oh yeah, one other thing, if you want no other guy but Chris, just<br>
go freaking kill that other bitch, and put a knife to Chris and order him to<br>
go out with you...<FONT Color="#ffffff">What the hell you at Steve, get away, I leave the computer<br>
for a second and hell breaks loose.<br>
<br>
Well, I know my advise may sound lame, but I really hope that it will help<br>
in some way or other. I am new at this after all. Also, I just hope someone<br>
takes the time to read this, holy cow!<br>
<br>
The best of luck,<br>
Gonzell

Dear Sarah Eliza-something-or-other,<br>
<br>
Aiieght, well I tried to read through the whole thing but  it got rather long<br>
but I did notice the word "boobs". So I'm just assuming that since you're a<br>
chick and you're talkng about boobs that you're a young teenage girl<br>
experimenting with <I>other</I> girls. And of course I'm cool with that. So the<br>
problem is probably that you're afraid what others will think, right? Well, it<br>
really doesn't matter what they think as long as you make it your life goal to<br>
encourage all lesbians too be more affectionate towards each other in large<br>
public areas, preferably areas with me in them. Yes, yes indeed...that would be<br>
wonderful, thanks for being so thoughtful, love you and boobs too.<br>
<br>
You're da breast...I mean best,<br>
Steve<br>
<br>
P.S. My immaturity level has reached a new high, maybe Gonzell could help because<br> 
today's not my day to help you and tomorrow ain't looking all that hot either.<br>
Hope you rot slowing and peacefully ;)<br>
