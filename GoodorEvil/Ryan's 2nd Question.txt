Dear Gonzell and da Whipped Steve, 

Well first I would like to thank Gonzell on his help with 
the question. And next I would like to say this so Steve, 
man you are just jealous that my mom's hotter then your's. 
Man that's all ya can do I mean everyone's mom ain't pretty 
and all (no offence to the rest of the mom's out there). 
Well anyways to the question.... If there was a girl that 
you kinda liked, but she already had a close friend that we 
consider a boyfriend,and they are kinda close and you wanted 
to be in that spot instead of the other guy. How would 
Gonzell go about this because to be honset I dont care how 
Steve would handle it because he is Whipped.
