What up people! Well, I'm going on vacation today and well, I'll be gone
for 2 weeks, maybe even more. I know your all going to cry or something, but
don't, its only 2 weeks, then I'll be back with more comics and stuff. So, there
will be NO comics for 2 weeks or more, sorry, no until I get back. Well, C-ya
my BIG fans!<br>

P.S. I'm sorry about not posting comics, I do have a life you know...I think
anyway...
