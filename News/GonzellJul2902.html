Well, I'm back my people! I have to say, my vaction SUCKED! It was the must
boring thing ever, we did just about the same thing we did last year, except
we did less AND it was less fun. Anywayz, enough about that hellish vaction.
Oh yeah, I'm VERY happy that the vaction wasn't two weeks long like I said.
Although, it was close enough to it...
<br>
<br>
The thing is, I'm back! I might not be publishing so many comics though. Also,
I've noticed that I was getting off the topic of RPG's and Video Games, so I
promise you that the ones coming up will be more about RPG's, and they WILL
be funny, and when I say funny, I mean...um...well, I guess funny is a good
enough word for it.
<br>
<br>
Everyone now---WARCRAFT 3 ROCKS!

P.S. Oh yeah, I seem to be behind in my "Good or Evil" post, the thing is, I
never got around to getting Steve to anwser the latest question yet. Promise
to get that up soon too!
