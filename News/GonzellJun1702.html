Well, I'm VERY glade to say, I'm done my exams. Really I was done
my exams Friday, but I was very busy partying all night long, baby!
Well, I'm not really going to be posting comics everyday, because
I'm not getting paid for it or anything and it sometimes can be
hard. The reason I wanted to post comics everyday, was to catch up
with "Penny Arcade," but I know thats not happening. I am going to
try to post comics as much as I can anywayz. Also got another comic
up today, check it out!
