Some guy signed my guest book and said "All I have to say, go to
http://www.keenspot.com and get hosted!" I don't think he noticed
that you have to PAY money just to be hosted there(although it is
banner free). There is no way I'm paying some company to host my
site, when I can have it hosted free here at http://www.geocities.com/
Anyway, I'm not getting paid for this site, If I was, I just might
go to a better host, but for now, I'm not being paid, and I'm
not paying anyone else!
