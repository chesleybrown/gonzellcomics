I have some cool new buttons up and running on my webpage. Such as the new
menu, which I think is much better then the old one. Also, now I have, under
the comic frame, two buttons, which allow you to skip to the first comic, or
go to the latest comics, also very cool. I've been trying to get an even better
menu up, but it seems not to want to work out. I might have to stick with
the one I have, oh well. Its not the end of the world. Also, Ryan the Nerd Monkey
has sent in a another question, relating to the one me and Steve answered
before. I can just see what Steve will answer back for this one now. Anywayz,
the site is working out nice and fine, if I say so myself. I'm not sure if
i said this yet, but I have a Links page up now, some cool links to other
cool comic sites, but not as good as mine, hehehe.<br>
