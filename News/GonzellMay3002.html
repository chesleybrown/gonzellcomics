I'm still posting a comic everyday now. The thing is, I don't even
know if people are looking at them. The only people that looked
at them were my friends, who I told to go visit and sign my guestbook
or I'd kick their ass! VISIT MY SITE, or not...I mean, not like I
can control you, right.

Gonzell, signing right back off!
