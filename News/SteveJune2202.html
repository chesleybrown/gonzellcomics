Ay yo, Steve's back in the house. Been away for a little because of the whole exam thing.<br>
But now I'm officially finished high school (3 drunks to that!). Anywho, spending my<br>
summer now just working and chillin' and giving Gonzell a hand with this site on occasion.<br>
We've both been trying to advertise the site more because we want more traffic and we're<br>
trying to make the site more and more appealing to you all. So we also added a section<br>
where you can send in problems and we'll both post our answers. It's lots of fun I promise!<br>
Hahah. Anywho, Gonzell and I are very "into" trying to make this site popular and interesting<br>
so any suggestions are always welcomed. Come forth with us to the second month of publishment!<br>
And celebrate with us as we approach 1 000 hits....maybe someday to see 100 000 hits...*drifts<br>
into a daze*. The site has shaped up a lot considering both me and Gonzell's lack of HTML<br>
in the beginning and much more is to come, I promise!<br>
<br>
Constantly changing,<br>
Steve
