Aiieght, Steve dropping a post here. I have no clue why because this page still looks like
someone ran over 7 or 8 times with a steam roller. But I'll drop a post every now and then
just to make sure Gonzell doesn't get carried away with anything. He likes to stretch the
truth on a "rare" occasion. I'll also be the one bringing you cool links and other news
that actually matters. I'm told the Guess Book is up so sign that unless you have something
better to do...like nothing. Ya, so I'm out.
