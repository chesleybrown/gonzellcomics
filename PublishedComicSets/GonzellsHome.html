This is Gonzell's House. Often, Gonzell and his friends hangout there. It is located below the outhouse, in Kukana Village. It may sound like a dirty spot but his house also has a "Time Portal." He discovered this time portal while blowing open his wall for something to do. This portal leads to Ryan's Future Home. To exit this building, you go up the stairs, which leads into the outhouse.
