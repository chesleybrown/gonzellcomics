This is The Mountain Hangout. Gonzell and his friends always hangout there, and thats how it got its name. Its a very nice mountain with 90 degree drop into a lake. Which makes it a perfect place to go diving. The Mountain Hangout is located stright up from Kukana Village. To exit The Mountain Hangout, you just climb down the latter.
