This is The Outhouse. Thats really all there is to it, although Steve thinks its a shed. The outhouse is also the entrance to Gonzell's Home. Just go down the stairs in the middle of the room to get there. To exit the building you just go out the door. The outhouse is located in Kakana Village, attached to Steve's Home.
