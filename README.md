# Gonzell Comics (from 2002)

This was one of my very first websites I built. I feel like this is the digital equivalent of sharing an old macaroni craft project from elementary school. Iâ€™m surprised I still had this saved in one of my folders after all these years. After coming across it I decided why not publish it again for the nostalgia (with some minor modifications to get it working again).

It was from 2002, but be as critical as you want. ðŸ˜…

I also [wrote about my experience](https://medium.com/@chesley/blast-from-my-past-gonzells-comics-a3da4bf358c5) getting this old code working into today's browsers. That in itself was an interesting experience!

You can now view what this site _mostly_ looked like back in 2002 keeping in mind your screen resolution is likely a lot higher now ðŸ˜….
